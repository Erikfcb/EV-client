For example, sound waves propagate via air molecules colliding with their neighbours. When the molecules collide, they also bounce away from each other (a restoring force). This keeps the molecules from continuing to travel in the direction of the wave. Electromagnetic waves do not require a medium. Instead, they consist of periodic oscillations of electrical and magnetic fields originally generated by charged particles, and can therefore travel through a vacuum. These types vary in wavelength, and include radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.\",\n        img: \"../assets/1.jpg\",\n        id: \"1\"\n      }, {\n        title: \"Mountains\",\n        text: \"A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak.
